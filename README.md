##  ðŸ‘‡ ANNOUNCEMENT  ðŸ‘‡
(Tuesday 04th of October 2022)

We've noticed  our repository has been excluded from HacktoberFest with no further explanation and as a group, mainly focused on building open-source projects, we feel very disappointed and dishearted by this decision. 

Our 2022 challenge was fun to create, it empowered developers of all levels to participate in this year's event, allowed us to learn from others and practice our CSS skills as well as it brought joy while seeing all fantastic submissions.

This repository hasn't been made in the the way that it goes against HacktoberFest values, in fact, we feel it celebrated HacktoberFest in its fullest. Everyone, with junior or senior skillsets, was able to participate and be a part of something global. Our intention was to have fun, create something nice and have fun while doing so, however, HacktoberFest staff decided to exlude the repository and that means all contributions to it were marked as invalid.

Over the years this event has become a tradition for us and many of us have been looking forward to it, working hard on maintaining the repository as well as creating new contributions and its why this decision doesn't feel right for us. 

As of now we won't be accepting any PRs coming our way as a part of HacktoberFest event, altough in the future we might update the text on the website and continue building our project in the way we intented it to be. 

Once again, a big thank you goes out to all that have participated this year - it has been great seeing all your contributions, reviewing your code and interacting with you on our Discord.
